Quickstart:

If you just want to try this out, go to the harness folder and run:
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py runserver



For production installation:

python setup.py install

After that, add the url handler to your Django url file:
(r'^', include('formunculous.urls')), 

replacing r'^' with whatever start you want to have such as r'^forms/'

Additionally in your django settings file be sure to add these two constants
APP_STORAGE_ROOT = '/path/to/put/uploaded/files'
APP_STORAGE_URL = '/path/to/urls' 
				  e.g. if r'^forms/' above then this would be '/forms/'

The last bit is to add formunculous as an installed app in your settings file.

Add:
'formunculous',
to your INSTALLED_APPS

Additionaly also utilizes the builtin django comments application so
you will also need to add 'django.contrib.comments',
to your INSTALLED_APPS as well.

If you intend on using the email notifications you will need to define
the SERVER_EMAIL and EMAIL_HOST constants in your settings file.  See the
django settings documentation for more details/options.
