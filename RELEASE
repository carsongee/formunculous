Formunculous 2.2.4 Release Notes:

    This is a minor bug fix release with two minor
	additional features.  
	A big thank you to Leho Kraav ( http://kraav.com/ )
	for his help with getting translations working properly
	and the split multi value field display code.

New Features:
	* CSV Export now includes the application ID as a field

	* Added template code to properly display multi-select field responses on
	  the thank you and review pages (Courtesy of Leho Kraav)

Bug Fixes:
	* Fixed unicode handling in CSV export

	* Added URLEncode filter for attached file links in thank you and review

	* Fixed several spacing issues and missing trans/ugettext strings
	  (Courtesy of Leho Kraav)

	* For additional language support, I setup the apply.html base template to 
	  try and include a language specific date picker from
	   http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ui/i18n/ if a language other 
	   than en or en-us is selected:
	  {{ MEDIA_URL }}formunculous/js/jquery.ui.datepicker-{{ LANGUAGE_CODE }}.js
	  (You must add the specific js to that folder for it to work)
	  (Courtesy Leho Kraav)

	* File type fields now properly check that the file name is less than the max
	  length allowed in the model.  There is still an edge case where the path plus
	  the file name is too long.  I have submitted a patch upstream to Django to
	  fix this.
