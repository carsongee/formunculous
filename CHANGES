Second major version:

New features:

* Builder now integrated with Django admin interface
* Forms can now be designated by django Site
* Subforms now exist and enable many to one forms
* There are new fields available including:
	  . US Phone Number
	  . US Zip code
	  . US State
* You can now have authenticated forms that can be filled out multiple times
* You can choose to display drop down form elements with radio buttons
* You can now have multi select drop down elements displayed either as
  checkboxes or via a select widget
* All templates used for forms are customizable (i.e. confirmation, thankyou,
  completion) by creating a template directory with the same name as the form
  definition's slug (i.e. contact-us/thankyou.html)
* Fields are marked as dropdown safe to prevent having a file field with
  dropdown selections, as this doesn't make sense.
* Completed forms are now searchable via the reviewing index
* Completed forms now have pagination, the number displayed is configurable
* CKEditor/WYSIWYG available on all HTML capable fields via a button

Bug fixes:

* Massive style cleanup and prettifying, more compatible with IE
* Fixed a sorting issue with submission date.
* Boolean fields now default to False, previously they defaulted to Null/None


Future release plans:
* Add bulk copying/per item copying of form elements in the building interface
* Show user previous submissions for multiple authenticated forms
